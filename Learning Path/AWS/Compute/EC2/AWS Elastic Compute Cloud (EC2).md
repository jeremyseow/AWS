# AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)

- only one role can be assigned to an EC2 instance at a time, and all applications on the instance share the same role and permissions

- EC2 instances use **instance roles**, AWS CLI uses **roles**

#### Monitoring

- **By default, your instance is enabled for basic monitoring**
- You can optionally enable detailed monitoring
	- After you enable detailed monitoring, the Amazon EC2 console displays monitoring graphs with a 1-minute period for the instance
- Basic monitoring
	- Data is available automatically in **5-minute periods at no charge**
- Detailed monitoring
	- Data is available in **1-minute periods for an additional cost**
	- To get this level of data, you must specifically enable it for the instance. For the instances where youâ€™ve enabled detailed monitoring, you can also get aggregated data across groups of similar instances
