- An automated security assessment service that helps you test the network accessibility of your EC2 instances and the security state of your applications running on the instances.
- Inspector uses IAM service-linked roles.

### Features
- Inspector provides an engine that analyzes system and resource configuration and monitors activity to determine what an assessment target looks like, how it behaves, and its dependent components. The combination of this telemetry provides a complete picture of the assessment target and its potential security or compliance issues.
- Inspector incorporates a built-in library of rules and reports. These include checks against best practices, common compliance standards and vulnerabilities.
- Automate security vulnerability assessments throughout your development and deployment pipeline or against static production systems.
- Inspector is an API-driven service that uses an optional agent, making it easy to deploy, manage, and automate.
