# Best Practices

Below are some of the best practices in working with AWS Lambda Functions:

 - Separate the Lambda handler (entry point) from your core logic.

 - Take advantage of Execution Context reuse to improve the performance of your function

 - Use AWS Lambda Environment Variables to pass operational parameters to your function.

 - Control the dependencies in your functionâ€™s deployment package.

 - Minimize your deployment package size to its runtime necessities.

 - Reduce the time it takes Lambda to unpack deployment packages

 - Minimize the complexity of your dependencies

 - Avoid using recursive code
 
 - You can configure a function to mount an Amazon EFS file system to a local directory. With Amazon EFS, your function code can access and modify shared resources securely and at high concurrency.
