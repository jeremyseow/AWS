# AWS Fargate

- A technology that you can use with Amazon ECS to run containers without having to manage servers or clusters of Amazon EC2 instances

- With AWS Fargate, you no longer have to provision, configure, or scale clusters of virtual machines to run containers
	- This removes the need to choose server types, decide when to scale your clusters, or optimize cluster packing
