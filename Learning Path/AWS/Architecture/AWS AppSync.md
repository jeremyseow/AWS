# AWS AppSync

AWS AppSync simplifies application development by letting you create a flexible API to securely access, manipulate, and combine data from one or more data sources. AppSync is a managed service that uses GraphQL to make it easy for applications to get exactly the data they need.

With AppSync, you can build scalable applications, including those requiring real-time updates, on a range of data sources such as NoSQL data stores, relational databases, HTTP APIs, and your custom data sources with AWS Lambda. For mobile and web apps, AppSync additionally provides local data access when devices go offline, and data synchronization with customizable conflict resolution, when they are back online

AWS AppSync is quite similar with Amazon Cognito Sync which is also a service for synchronizing application data across devices. It enables user data like app preferences or game state to be synchronized as well however, the key difference is that, it also extends these capabilities by allowing multiple users to synchronize and collaborate in real time on shared data.
