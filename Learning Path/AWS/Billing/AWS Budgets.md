# AWS Budgets

- AWS Budgets lets customers set custom budgets and receive alerts if their costs or usage exceed (or are forecasted to exceed) their budgeted amount

- AWS requires approximately 5 weeks of usage data to generate budget forecasts
	- If you set a budget to alert based on a forecasted amount, this budget alert isn't triggered until you have enough historical usage information

- Stand-alone accounts can create budgets and being part of an AWS Organization is not mandatory to use AWS Budgets
