# AWS Billing and Cost Management

By default, IAM users do not have access to the AWS Billing and Cost Management console. You or your account administrator must grant users access. You can do this by activating IAM user access to the Billing and Cost Management console and attaching an IAM policy to your users. Then, you need to activate IAM user access for IAM policies to take effect. You only need to activate IAM user access once.
