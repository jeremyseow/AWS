# AWS CloudWatch

- A service that that monitors AWS resources and the applications you run on AWS in real time

- You can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which are variables you can measure for your resources and applications

- CloudWatch is basically a metrics repository
	- An AWS service, such as EC2, puts metrics into the repository, and you retrieve statistics based on those metrics
	- If you put your own custom metrics into the repository, you can retrieve statistics on these metrics as well
	
- You can use metrics to calculate statistics and then present the data graphically in the CloudWatch console
