# Kinesis Data Streams

By default, the 2MB/second/shard output is shared between all of the applications consuming data from the stream. You should use enhanced fan-out if you have multiple consumers retrieving data from a stream in parallel. With enhanced fan-out developers can register stream consumers to use enhanced fan-out and receive their own 2MB/second pipe of read throughput per shard, and this throughput automatically scales with the number of shards in a stream
