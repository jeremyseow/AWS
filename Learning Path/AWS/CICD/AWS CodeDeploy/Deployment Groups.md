# Deployment Groups

- You can specify one or more deployment groups for a CodeDeploy application
- The deployment group contains settings and configurations used during the deployment
- Most deployment group settings depend on the compute platform used by your application
- Some settings, such as rollbacks, triggers, and alarms can be configured for deployment groups for any compute platform
