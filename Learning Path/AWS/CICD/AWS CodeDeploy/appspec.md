The application specification file (AppSpec file) is a YAML-formatted or JSON-formatted file used by CodeDeploy to manage a deployment. It must be placed in the `root` of the directory structure of an application's source code.

The AppSpec file is used to:
- Map the source files in your application revision to their destinations on the instance.
- Specify custom permissions for deployed files.
- Specify scripts to be run on each instance at various stages of the deployment process.

During deployment, the CodeDeploy agent looks up the name of the current event in the hooks section of the AppSpec file. If the event is not found, the CodeDeploy agent moves on to the next step. If the event is found, the CodeDeploy agent retrieves the list of scripts to execute. The scripts are run sequentially, in the order in which they appear in the file. The status of each script is logged in the CodeDeploy agent log file on the instance.
