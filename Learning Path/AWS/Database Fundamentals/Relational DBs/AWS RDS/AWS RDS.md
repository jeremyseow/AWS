The automated backup feature of Amazon RDS enables point-in-time recovery for your database instance. Amazon RDS will backup your database and transaction logs and store both for a user-specified retention period. If itâ€™s a Multi-AZ configuration, backups occur on the standby to reduce I/O impact on the primary. Automated backups are limited to a single AWS Region while manual snapshots and Read Replicas are supported across multiple Regions.
