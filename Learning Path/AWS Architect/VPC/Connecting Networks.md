#### AWS Transit Gateway
AWS Transit Gateway provides a hub and spoke design for connecting VPCs and on-premises networks. You can attach all your hybrid connectivity (VPN and Direct Connect connections) to a single Transit Gateway consolidating and controlling your organizationâ€™s entire AWS routing configuration in one place. It also controls how traffic is routed among all the connected spoke networks using route tables. This hub and spoke model simplifies management and reduces operational costs because VPCs only connect to the Transit Gateway to gain access to the connected networks.
