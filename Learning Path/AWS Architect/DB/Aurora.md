- Cluster Endpoint: The cluster endpoint points to the current master database instance. Using the Cluster endpoint allows your application to perform read and writes against the master instance.
- Reader Endpoint: The reader endpoint load balancers connections across the read replica fleet within the cluster.
- Custom Endpoint: A custom endpoint load balancer's connections across a set of cluster instances that you choose and register within the custom endpoint. Custom endpoints can be used to group instances based on instance size or maybe group them on a particular db parameter group. You can then dedicate the custom endpoint for a specific role or task within your organization - for example, you may have a requirement to generate month-end reports - therefore you connect to a custom endpoint that has been specifically set up for this task. 
- Instance Endpoint: An instance endpoint maps directly to a cluster instance. Each and every cluster instance has its own instance endpoint. You can use an instance endpoint when you want fine-grained control over which instance you need to service your requests.
